Week 1

This week I gathered data on the death penalty practices of each state in the United States. If a state still practices the death penalty, I researched the amount of inmates currently on death row; if the state did not support it, I researched the year the death penalty became abolished. I struggled with creating a choropleth map on Leaflet this week. I was able to download the template, but I had a lot of hiccups in incorporating the data on my json file to the map itself. I was not able to get the map as functional as I thought it could this week. I will continue working on it.
