Week 1

This week I gathered data on the death penalty practices of each state in the United States. If a state still practices the death penalty, I researched the amount of inmates currently on death row; if a state did not support it, I researched the year the death penalty became abolished. I struggled with creating a choropleth map on Leaflet this week. I was able to download the template, but I had a lot of hiccups in incorporating the data on my json file to the map itself. I was not able to get the map as functional as I thought it could this week. I will continue working on it. 

Week 2
This week I worked on making my Choropleth map fully functional. I was able to include the number of death row inmates per state and/or the date the death penalty was abolished when a user hovers over a state. I was also able to make the map zoom-in on a state when clicked. I also gathered data for the past four murder rates per state using Uniform Crime Reports from the FBI. With this data, I compared the murder rate in states that pratice the death penalty and compared them to states that do not. I also added a media query for the page and styled the map a bit.
